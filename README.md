Pretty Easy PGP
===

After having tried to make PGP easy to set up and use in chrome, this
project attempt to write an extension to manage and share PGP keys and easy to
extend with PGP helper (Such as gmail-pgp or facebook-pgp). It should 
be designed in such a way that other extension can be built on top of
this to bring features in page content.
